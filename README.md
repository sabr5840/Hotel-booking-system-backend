# Hotel Booking System backend

## About the Project
This Hotel Booking System is an advanced application developed as part of a 24-hour exam challenge. It allows users to search for and book hotel rooms and enables hotel administrators to manage bookings and room details. The backend is powered by Spring Boot, ensuring robust server-side logic and REST API endpoints. Data handling is facilitated by Java Persistence API (JPA), while the frontend is crafted with HTML and CSS for a user-friendly interface.
